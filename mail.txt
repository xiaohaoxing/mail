Dear Butterick,

My name is Xinye and I am a journalist working for Yi Magazine which is a leading media in China, mainly focusing on bussiness and tech. I am writing to invite you for an interview regarding the lawsuits filed against GitHub Copilot and Sta­ble Dif­fu­sion, as well as to get your expert opinions on several related topics.

We would be grateful if you could share your views on the following questions:

1. What are your core concerns regarding AIGC? Which types of AIGC content pose the most significant problems, and why?
2. How do you view the potential risk of copyright infringement associated with ChatGPT?
3. With Github being acquired by Microsoft and Openai evolving from an open-source organization to a tool for the closed-loop platform  Microsoft, has the open-source culture in the tech industry become a false proposition?
4. How feasible is it to protect the intellectual property rights of original work and ?

The interview can be conducted via zoom or email, whichever is more convenient for you. We anticipate the interview to take approximately 30-60 minutes.

Please let me know if this is something that interests you and your availability for the interview. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards.
